# Python-Algo
This is where I store all of my projects in Python which are directly linked to the algorithm course we have at IMT-NE.  
While Python is not a really good language to me, it's always cool to try something new, and it helps at writing a sort of pseudo code.
Use `mypy` in order to check if a file is correctly typed, however it should have already been checked before uploading, but who knows.

# License
I will try to put a license at the top of every file, the majority of my projects should be licensed under *WTFPL* : in short terms, do what the fuck you want to.
